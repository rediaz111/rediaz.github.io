<p class="lead text-center">
I am a structural biologist with a special interest in visualizing enzyme conformational dynamics. I am working as a graduate student with [Dr. James Fraser](http://fraserlab.com "Fraser lab at UCSF (opens in new tab)"){:target="_blank"}, using X-ray crystallography and enzymology to characterize pH-specificity of mammalian chitinases.

<br>
<br>

I received my B.S. with Honors in neuroscience from the University of Miami, where I worked with [Dr. Vance Lemmon](https://www.lembixlab.net/ "Lembix lab at the University of Miami (opens in new tab)"){:target="_blank"} studying the role of transcription factor hyperactivation in CNS axon regeneration.

<br>

Beyond my scientific interests, I am excited about diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, open access, and the interplay between basic science and society.
