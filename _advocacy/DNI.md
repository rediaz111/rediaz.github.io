title: 'Diversity Network Initiative'
description: "I identiﬁed an unmet need to connect current and prospective PhD students from similar backgrounds. The DNI was created to build community and a professional network, share experiences, and provide insight into diversity and inclusion efforts at UCSF. Currently, seven basic science graduate programs participate in the Diversity Network Initiative. This initiative was developed in partnership with Dr. D’Anne Duncan, Asst. Dean of Diversity and Learner Success."
