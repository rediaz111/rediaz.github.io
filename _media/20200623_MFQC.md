description: "This week on the pod, Bec and Geraldo talk with Roberto Efraín (Robbie) Díaz (he/him), a graduate student in the Fraser Lab in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). We talk about his work with the Graduate and Postdoctoral Queer Alliance (GPQA), how his different identities have intersected with his scientific career, the barriers to LGBTQ+ inclusion in academia and how those can be taken down, and so much more! We hope y'all are enjoying our Pride Month special and remember that Black lives matter today and everyday."
