<!-- I am always happy to talk about any and all of the projects I have worked on, as well as any new ideas for the future. In particular, lately I have been thinking about computational methods to make sense of electron density, as well as identifying new ways for scientists to interact with structural data.

I aim to share all of my work, scientific or otherwise, as publically as possible and would be happy to share anything that is not available on public sources. -->
