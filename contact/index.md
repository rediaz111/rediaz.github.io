The easiest way to get in touch with me is by [email](mailto:roberto.diaz@ucsf.edu) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/robbiediaz_)

I am always happy to talk about any and all of the projects I have worked on, as well as any new ideas for the future. In particular, lately I have been thinking about how science education reinforces the myth that science is objective and apolitical, as well as how can basic scientists engage with community members who are directly affected by their research.

I aim to share all of my work, scientific or otherwise, as publicly as possible and would be happy to share anything that is not available on public sources.
