description: "Robbie's central focus on advocacy reaches beyond the success of any individual, aiming instead to bolster the health of a diverse community. He is acutely aware of how marginalized people's careers frequently take a back seat to existential threats to oneself or one's community, and he works tirelessly to secure everyone's physical and psychological safety.


Robbie bravely shares his personal (and sometimes uncomfortable) experiences as a Queer, Latinx individual trying to navigate the difficult world of academia to remind us that we are not alone in the daily challenges we as queer individuals face. Robbie taught me and many others the importance of being, in his words, “unapologetically proud” of our sexualities – to both normalize our presence in the scientific community and to foster a more inclusive environment for the next generation to come."
