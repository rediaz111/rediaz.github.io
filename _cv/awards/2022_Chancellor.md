description: "Edison Uno was Assistant Dean of Students at UCSF from 1969 to 1974. In addition to his job responsibilities, he was a participant and leader in a number of social and political causes and organizations. He was involved in the struggle to repeal the law that permitted the incarceration of Japanese Americans in detention camps, and was one of the leaders of the effort to establish the Ethnic Studies program at San Francisco State University during the 1960s. In the 1970s, he was the first person of Japanese descent to be appointed to serve on the San Francisco Grand Jury, while at the same time a critic of that system's exclusion of other minorities.  These are but a few examples that demonstrate Mr. Uno's commitment to human rights and social change. This award was established in 1980 to recognize dedication and commitment to established social, political and civic groups that bring about social change."
